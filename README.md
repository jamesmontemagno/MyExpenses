## My Expenses

Expense taking cross platform application for Windows Phone, Android, and iOS built with Xamarin inside of Visual Studio 2013. Expenses are stored locally in a Sqlite-net database. You can add new expenses and edit or delete existing. All business logic is shared in one portable class library.

Written in C# with ([Xamarin](http://www.xamarin.com))  **Created in Visual Studio 2013**

Open Source Project by ([@JamesMontemagno](http://www.twitter.com/jamesmontemagno)) 

For Windows Phone you must install SQLite for Windows Phone Extension: https://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/cd120b42-30f4-446e-8287-45387a4f40b7?WT.mc_id=friends-0000-jamont

** For Azure Mobile Services Integration please read the setup at the bottom of this page! **

## How much code is shared?
I have included an "Analysis Project", which will count the shared lines of code. Up to 80% of code is shared across platforms. All of the Models, Services, View Models, and tons of helper classes are all found in one single PCL library. 

## What technology is used?
Everything is written in C# with Xamarin with a base PCL library. This project couldn't have been done without the following:

### Json.NET
https://components.xamarin.com/view/json.net - I use both the NuGet in the PCL and component for iOS for facade linking. One of the most wonderful Json libraries that I simply love. It is used to deserialize all information coming from the meetup.com APIs. PCL is also used for this and I reference the portable-net40 folder to ensure iOS works correctly.

### Azure Mobile Services
https://www.nuget.org/packages/WindowsAzure.MobileServices/ and https://components.xamarin.com/view/azure-mobile-services Used optionally to store data up into Azure and sync between devices! I use the NuGet in Windows Phone and PCL and then the components for each iOS and Android. See below for more information.

### HTTP Client Libraries
https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Net.Http - Brings HTTP Client functionality to Windows Phone in PCL.

### Windows Phone Toolkit
http://phone.codeplex.com/ - Everyone's favorite WP toolkit!

### ANDHud
https://components.xamarin.com/view/AndHUD - Brings in a nice spinner for Xamarin.Android

### BTProgressHud
https://components.xamarin.com/view/btprogresshud - Great spinner for iOS

### MonoTouch.Dialog
http://docs.xamarin.com/guides/ios/user_interface/monotouch.dialog/ - A wonderful library for Xamarin.iOS to create user interfaces quick with not a lot of code.

### Sqlite-net PCL
https://github.com/praeclarum/sqlite-net - A wonderful library for cross platform sqlite databases.
Now in PCL form with: https://github.com/oysteinkrog/Sqlite.net-pcl

### Azure Mobile Services Integration

* Create a new Azure Mobile Services Table Called "Expense"
* Follow this guide to setup the Table for Authentication: https://www.windowsazure.com/develop/mobile/tutorials/get-started-with-users-dotnet/?WT.mc_id=friends-0000-jamont

* Setup Azure Scripts for Insert, Read, Update: https://www.windowsazure.com/develop/mobile/tutorials/authorize-users-in-scripts-dotnet/?WT.mc_id=friends-0000-jamont

* Setup Twitter App for Authentication: http://www.dotnetcurry.com/ShowArticle.aspx?ID=860

* Optionally you can setup Facebook, Microsoft, or Google, however the sample is setup for Twitter

* Open "AzureService.cs" a shared file in MyEpenses.Android (or iOS or WindowsPhone) and 
* Comment Back In & Edit: MobileClient = new MobileServiceClient(
        
"https://"+"PUT-SITE-HERE" +".azure-mobile.net/",
        
"PUT-YOUR-API-KEY-HERE");

* This information can be found on Azure
